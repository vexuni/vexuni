1. Read [architecture](docs/en/ARCHITECTURE.md), particularly R2-before-refs ordering and authorization.
2. Install Node.js 22.13+ and npm. Native Git and tar are required for tests, not the service runtime.
3. Run `npm ci` and `npm run dev`. Wrangler starts the Git service on 8787 and the private WASM compiler service together. `npm run dev:build` can run the compiler separately on 8788.
4. For protocol/storage/auth changes, run `npm run check`, `npm run test:e2e` and `npm run build:production`. Use native Git as an independent compatibility oracle and add focused failure regressions.
5. Format with `npm run format`. Describe behavior, verification and migration impact. Add numbered SQL migrations instead of editing applied ones.

Do not introduce Containers, shell processes or a native Git dependency into the service runtime. Do not execute repository code/hooks in the Git service, trust caller-selected storage IDs, acknowledge writes before persistence, bypass role checks or store raw passwords/tokens. Only operator-approved webhook receivers may receive events.

Local E2E creates `e2e_` fixtures and refuses non-loopback hosts. Do not weaken that guard to run against a production database. Cloud acceptance must use a separate, narrowly scoped script and temporary credentials/fixtures. Keep `.data`, `.wrangler`, `.dev.vars` and all credentials out of source control.

For browser changes, run `npm run test:ui` against the local server. This optional suite uses Playwright (`npm install --no-save --package-lock=false playwright`), with `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` pointing to an installed Chrome/Chromium executable, or a browser installed with `npx playwright install chromium`. An existing Playwright installation may instead be selected with the absolute `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` path to its `index.mjs`. The suite creates isolated browser contexts and temporary repositories/workspaces, disables its test user during cleanup, and writes screenshots under `.data/v12-ui`. It never uses the operator's browser profile. Wait for cleanup to finish before editing Worker code or rebuilding assets, since Wrangler reload interrupts in-flight acceptance requests.

For cross-fork review changes, first run `KEEP_REVIEW_FIXTURE=1 npm run test:reviews`, then `npm run test:review-ui` with the same Playwright options. This local-only suite exercises source selection, branch loading, creation, both sides of a diff, discussion/reply pagination, review and CI gates, and an actual merge. It retains the main fixture for inspection, closes its pagination request, deletes the extra fork, and logs out its isolated browser sessions. Generate a fresh fixture before re-running: a completed merge is intentionally irreversible. Screenshots are under `.data/v13-review-ui`; fixture credentials stay in ignored `.data` files.

For CI workflow changes, run `npm run test:workflows` for real Dynamic Worker jobs, versioned configuration, cancellation/publication gates and the shipped external Runner. Run `npm run test:workflow-git` for native Git push, automatic versioned workflow execution, clone and strict fsck. Then run `npm run test:workflow-ui` with the browser options above for configuration modes, task navigation, snapshot retry, mobile layout and reader permissions. These suites use temporary fixtures and must finish cleanup before Worker or asset changes.

For Git persistence changes, also run `npm run test:git-reliability`: it extends the native Git fixture with repeated API commits, concurrent expected-SHA writers, a stale-write rejection and native incremental push/fetch before clone/fsck. Provider failure cases belong in `tests/git-reliability.test.ts`; never inject storage failures into production. Remote suites require `ALLOW_REMOTE_ACCEPTANCE=1`, `TEST_ORIGIN` and a private `VEXUNI_TOKEN_FILE`. Capture only sanitized diagnostic fields when examining production incidents.

For scheduled CI changes, run `npm run test:schedules` and `npm run test:schedule-ui`. The former waits for a real Cron/Queue occurrence (up to nine minutes on Cloudflare); the latter uses the same optional Playwright environment. Await fixture cleanup before rebuilding or deploying. Remote acceptance requires explicit opt-in and a private token file.

For CI variables, run `npm run test:variables` (real Worker and shipped external Runner, lease/rotation/log masking) and `npm run test:variable-ui` (write-only values, edits, permissions, mobile). The same fixture cleanup and remote opt-in rules apply. Never use real deployment credentials as test variable values.

For shared CI caches, run `npm run test:caches` and `npm run test:cache-ui`. Verify real Worker and shipped external Runner reuse, failed workflow isolation, generation invalidation, lease rejection, bounded archive extraction, quota and eventual R2 reclamation. Wait for all fixtures to finish cleanup before editing runtime files or deploying.

For native TypeScript/npm builds, run `npm run test:builds` with a local application gateway connected to the same local D1/R2 (`TEST_APPS_ORIGIN`, default localhost:8789). See [native builds](docs/en/CI-BUILDS-v22.md) for service deployment order, dependency restrictions and acceptance. Never connect a local fixture gateway to production storage.

For interface changes, translate application-owned literals explicitly through `src/browser/i18n.js` and `src/i18n/en.json`; never translate user text, code, or already-rendered HTML. Preserve template placeholders. Add both Simplified Chinese and English documentation pages, then run `npm run docs`, `npm run check`, and `npm run test:i18n` against an isolated local instance. The language selector persists a non-sensitive preference; source and document language links must point to their counterparts.
