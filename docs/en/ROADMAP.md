# Feature mapping and development scope

[简体中文](../ROADMAP.md) · **English**

The Code Storage comparison was recorded on 2026-09-08 against vexuni v0.2/e72e52d. Research covered 101 distinct public documentation pages and OpenAPI. [parity.json](../parity.json) maps 40 preferred operations and 11 cross-cutting capabilities to real implementations/tests; upstream documentation was researched, not redistributed as project source.

The initial six objectives covered authorization/ref isolation and signatures; complete bounded Git APIs; repository lifecycle; encrypted upstream connections and real synchronization; TypeScript/Python/Go SDKs, MCP, and agent examples; and successful/failing acceptance before deployment. v0.3 implemented all 51 mapped behaviors, with 40 preferred REST operations exercised on temporary Cloudflare projects. See [verification](VERIFICATION.md). Actual private GitHub App installations still need operator configuration; tests do not establish unlimited scale, SLA, every Git protocol, or full recursive-merge compatibility.

The implementation remains container-free, with JavaScript Git processing and durable R2 data rather than a hot-disk/cold-storage model. Its own API/SDK conventions are not a drop-in base-URL replacement. Missing real third-party credentials must be documented, never replaced by simulated success claims.

## Agreed scope

The user narrowed the broad GitLab/Gogs development objective to the work through v0.37. Subsequent capabilities are separate requests. v0.38 adds the requested primary-domain migration and complete Simplified Chinese/English platform/documentation support; it does not claim all GitLab features or remove existing engine limits. See [deployment](DEPLOYMENT.md) and [limits](LIMITS.md).

## Remaining boundaries

Large initial-import throughput, uncached clones, concurrent complete Git streams, permanent packed-object storage, large fork/history algorithms, and coordinated backup recovery need separate work and evidence; see [scale plan](GIT-SCALE-PLAN.md). Full Linux/npm toolchains inside Workers, GitLab YAML/API parity, SSH/shallow/partial transport, all-history/multi-branch/regex global indexing, other package registries, scanning/quality reports, PDF preview, SAML/SCIM/Access/backchannel logout, email recovery, and recovery after losing all second factors are not implied by the delivered stages.
